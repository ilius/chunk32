Eight years ago, the Go team introduced goinstall (which led to go get) and with it the decentralized, URL-like import paths that Go developers are familiar with today. After we released goinstall, one of the first questions people asked was how to incorporate version information. We admitted we didnâ€™t know. For a long time, we believed that the problem of package versioning would be best solved by an add-on tool, and we encouraged people to create one. The Go community created many tools with different approaches. Each one helped us all better understand the problem, but by mid-2015 it was clear that there were now too many solutions. We needed to adopt a single, official tool.
