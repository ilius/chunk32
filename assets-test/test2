The most important new feature of Go 1 was not a language feature. It was Go 1’s emphasis on backwards compatibility. Until that point we’d issued stable release snapshots approximately monthly, each with significant incompatible changes. We observed significant acceleration in interest and adoption immediately after the release of Go 1. We believe that the promise of compatibility made developers feel much more comfortable relying on Go for production use and is a key reason that Go is popular today. Since 2013 the Go FAQ has encouraged package developers to provide their own users with similar expectations of compatibility. We call this the import compatibility rule: “If an old package and a new package have the same import path, the new package must be backwards compatible with the old package.”
